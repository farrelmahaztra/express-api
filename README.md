# Creating a REST API

This is a simple example of a REST API may look like, done in Express.

## Setup

1. Clone this repository

```
git clone https://github.com/farrelmahaztra/express-api.git
```

2. Move into the directory

```
cd express-api
```

3. Install dependencies

```
npm install
```

4. Run the server

```
node index.js
```

## Notes

- Like with last week's state management talk, this isn't the only way to create a REST API. There's plenty to improve!
